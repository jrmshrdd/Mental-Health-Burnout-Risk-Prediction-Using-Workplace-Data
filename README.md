# Mental-Health-Burnout-Risk-Prediction-Using-Workplace-Data
A machine learning-powered Streamlit app that predicts burnout risk based on workplace and mental health survey data, with interpretable SHAP visualizations.

# Description

An interactive web application that predicts the risk of mental health burnout based on workplace and behavioral factors. Built using Python, machine learning (Random Forest), and deployed with Streamlit, this project integrates data science with real-time prediction, visualization, and explainability.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Predict burnout risk using real-world tech employee survey data  
- Explore and visualize workplace factors contributing to mental stress  
- Build an end-to-end pipeline from data preprocessing to model deployment  
- Explain predictions using SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations)  
- Deliver a user-friendly interface for real-time interaction
